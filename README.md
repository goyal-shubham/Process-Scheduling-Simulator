# Process-Scheduling-Simulator

A simulator is designed to measure the performance of the algorithms based on the average response time and turn around time. In addition, We modified the MLFQ scheduling algorithm to
improve the performance. Traditional MLFQ uses Round Robin scheme for the jobs in the same queue. Instead of Round Robin selecting the next job in the queue, the performance of the
algorithm improved when we picked the shortest job first. This tool can be used to analyze the performance of the following CPU scheduling algorithms:
1) First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2) Shortest Job First Scheduling (SJF)
3) Improved Round Robin Scheduling (RR)
4) MultiLevel FeedBack Queue (MLFQ)
5) MultiLevel FeedBack Queue with SJF (MLFQSJF)
